# 1. About the Project
    This is a class project in which a group of classmates have to work together to produce a working application/project. 
    The team should have at least two members.  All members of the team should contribute in some way to the project, which should be noted with commits, pushes, pulls, and team discussions.  
    
    This class project uses the YouTube API which dilsplays eight videos.  The videos displayed depends on the search.


# 2. Built With
    This project is built with using the following framworks/libraries:
        * React
        * Bootstrap

# 3. Getting Started

    First understand that you will be setting a project on your local device and you are collaborating with other team members. Every team member will be making changes in relation to their assigned task(s).  Every team member will be pushing from their branch and making pull requests from the main project branch. 
    
    Your team should have a project manager -- ideally this person will be the teammate who created the initial github project. This person would be the one to accepts pull requests.

    This is a project which should start by setting up a project on your local machine.  This project should help you to become a better coder and a more productive team member. The focus is on the ability to collaborate with others and be a productive member of a team using your strengths while working on areas that you feel you can improve on.  
    
    The point of this project is to be honest and open about your perceived weaknesses.  You should focus on being a productive member of a software engineering team and you should also focus on learning/evolving/growing.  

    Starting a branch may be different depending on the device you are working on (i.e. Apple vs. Microsoft devide).

      # a. Prerequisites
          * You need to have Node Package Manager (NPM) installed on your device.
          * You need to be comfortable using the Command Line Interface (CLI).  
            -- For Apple devices
          * That will be the Terminal/Iterm/etc...  
            -- For Microsoft devices
          *Open the Command Prompt
